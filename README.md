## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

![TODO: Update the path with the name of your diagram](Images/diagram_filename.png)

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the _____ file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

  - _TODO: Enter the playbook file._

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly available, in addition to restricting access to the network.
- _TODO: What aspect of security do load balancers protect? What is the advantage of a jump box?_
Availability, 

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the files and system logs.
- _TODO: What does Filebeat watch for?_
- _TODO: What does Metricbeat record?_

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.
_Note: Use the [Markdown Table Generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) to add/remove values from the table_.

| Name     | Function   | IP Address | Operating System |
|----------|----------  |------------|------------------|
| Jump Box | Gateway    | 10.0.0.1   | Linux            |
| Web-1    | Web server |   Private  | Linux            |
| Web-2    | Web server |   Private  | Linux            |
| Elk      | Monitor    |   Private  | Linux            |

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the Jump Box machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
My computer's public IP address: 173.79.124.184
- _TODO: Add whitelisted IP addresses_

Machines within the network can only be accessed by the Jump Box. Private IP address of Jump Box is 10.0.0.4.
- _TODO: Which machine did you allow to access your ELK VM? What was its IP address?_

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Jump Box | Yes                 | My public IP address |
| Elk      | Yes                 | Any IP address       |
| Web-1/2  | Yes                 | Any IP address       |

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because it reduces chances of human error and maximizes efficiency by having all the machines configured by the same playbooks.
- _TODO: What is the main advantage of automating configuration with Ansible?_

The playbook implements the following tasks:
- _TODO: In 3-5 bullets, explain the steps of the ELK installation play. E.g., install Docker; download image; etc._
- Install Docker
- Install pip3, python interpreter
- Install Docker python module
- Use systemctl module/use more memory
- Download and launch a docker elk container

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines: 10.0.0.6, 10.0.0.5 ; Private IP addresses of Web-1 and Web-2

- _TODO: List the IP addresses of the machines you are monitoring_

We have installed the following Beats on these machines: 
40.83.208.77 ; Web-1 and Web-2 VM

- _TODO: Specify which Beats you successfully installed_

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine: Filebeat collects and looks at system file changes, such as CPU system changes such as memory usage. Metricbeat collects and looks at system logs.
- _TODO: In 1-2 sentences, explain what kind of data each beat collects, and provide 1 example of what you expect to see. E.g., `Winlogbeat` collects Windows logs, which we use to track user logon events, etc._

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the playbook file to the /etc directory.
- Update the host file to include the private IP addresses for the VM's that were being configured.
- Run the playbook, and navigate to Elk server's IP address;port 5601 to check that the installation worked as expected.

_TODO: Answer the following questions to fill in the blanks:_
- _Which file is the playbook? Where do you copy it?_
- _Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on?_
- _Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running?

_As a **Bonus**, provide the specific commands the user will need to run to download the playbook, update the files, etc._
Command to run and download the playbook: ansible-playbook
